# Count it!

This project consists of writing a recursive Python function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords.

## Requirements
- The script must be written in Python 3.
- The Requests module is used to handle HTTP requests.
- The function should handle pagination via the "after" parameter.
- If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, the script should print nothing.
